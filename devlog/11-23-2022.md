omg I have some days off nice, going to put some real time into this, on my main computer too not the PBP so I have more screen room/be more productive

[ ] finish a usable UI
[ ] fully bridge sqlite/rust/frontend
[ ] make external API sync for extension (save tabs)
[ ] sync data from other note taking apps

I don't think I'd get all the above done today but I have four days off baby.

1:49 PM

damn mad distracted

my e key is acting up on durgod hades 68 sad, but I've had it like 2-3 years now

I would re-buy it but they don't have cherry red

it does suck to buy the same thing more than once

I'm not really feeling the drive to build this right now but I need to, it's a blocker for me mentally

Normally I can just bust this out but it's been a bit and the rust layer is new to me, currently it's using mocked stuff and doesn't work all the way down to sqlite

2:18 PM

still haven't started, I've got it open

So I've got search, open item, same item opens again though that's not good

oh crap render order changes

2:29 PM

I think I'll focus on the rust/sqlite part today, even with a crap UI

2:36 PM

lol I'm back to this, where tf is the database

oh... okay I'm using in memory storage so there is no file right now

I think after I get it working I would use in memory that sinks to API for persistence

I could use a file but idk... security maybe eg. non-plaintext db file

ehh... I'll just do it

3:00 PM

damn this is brutal but I'm making progress

3:20 PM

damn it nothing is simple lol, want to concatenate a string, need like 3 lines minimum

stuck on this

```
  .into_iter()
  ^^^^^^^^^ method cannot be called on `Statement<'_>` due to unsatisfied trait bounds
```

The code I'm running is straight out of documentation pretty much so not sure what's up.

3:44 PM ugh... I have some options... I could use a wrapper that might help

or figure out this issue (persisting the same connection)

Trying to use non-memory (file) is an option too

everytime the connection :memory: is used it's a new instance so no previous tables

4:41 PM

back to same problem before ugh, the block above
