sleep pattern shifting, not great

I did get help but still don't have it working

I'm contemplating on using something like diesel or rusqlite

4:24 PM

I decided I would develop this app on PBP... then I can talk about it how I made this app in PBP for PBP

Also I gotta justifyf buying these things.

I am cheating by having an external computer/monitor to look at for research

This laptop is hanging off my desk so that's not great.

At least I put that load bearing support inside.

I have to put time into learning one of these things... apparently rusqlite is lighter than diesel

https://github.com/rusqlite/rusqlite

it's probably not possible on this laptop's hardware to screen record but I'll try it

there is lag when using this laptop, like typing can take a bit to show up/catch up

interesting as I run simplescreenrecorder the right speaker makes a high pitch sound, it's not unbearable but it's there

it sounds like a cpu fan that's going at full blast

since the emmc is only 64gb I'm concenred about storage used, also I added vlc to play the video

it does put more lag on typing as it records seems obvious, still usable though

cool video playback looks good

I'll record video later on when I'm more productive/just jamming

5:00 PM

This is not going great, I keep running into problems... even just following docs... which I know I'm not 100% following the docs since I'm injecting it into Tauri

ugh... I don't get how an app would run migrations unless it's part of the install process

I see someone else doing it so it is possible

It is just annoying this learning wall if I built it with electron/all JS stack I would potentially be done already

I've been too privileged with a language like JS

I want to scream, REEEEEEE everything in rust is a battle for me right now (optimism)

This is a dumb CRUD app and I'm stuck on the DB layer

Alright... I will follow this tutorial top to bottom in a separate layer

It's unfortunate that the doc is for postgres but it should just be swappable generally.
