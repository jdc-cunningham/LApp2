A little distracted at the moment (working on Pinephone Pro stuff)

Earlier I was trying to make a "system tray app" which I thought meant you could modify the taskbar on Windows

But it's just a little icon

So I kind of abandoned that effort, but I want to improve my note taking/life app.

Rust is on my list of things to learn so why not use it with a desktop-wrapper JS app

I'm also thinking about migrating my data/encrypted to the cloud... idk this requires processes

Probably do some kind of local unencrypted, remote encrypted, sync job that runs at night

I'm going to put some time into my hardware projects too

So not sure how far I'll get into this project this weekend

One of the main things I'm trying to capture is my list of projects/state of mind with these kind of apps

I'm able to modify my browser/work with that, in conjunction with some shared DB/API for a cross-platform app, missing mobile.
