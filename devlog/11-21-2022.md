6:52 PM

let me see if I can get this to run on Manjaro/Arch64

something neat would be to make a logger for usage of this laptop (some suspend/systemd thing)

I've made one before for tracking battery life on a chromebook

running `npm install` let's time it

6:55 done pretty much right away okay

the first run of Tauri is brutal let's see how that goes

6:56

I'm connected to 5GHz wifi

I'm seeing 6-9MiB/s speed for fetch crates.io

Ooh 9.02 CPU load nice

Damn 7:06 PM build failed

Oh right I gotta satisfy all these missing deps.

this one was missing `javascriptcoregtk-4.0`, it's `webkit2gtk`

19:25:30 start

19:35:55 damn still going

19:37:35 aye it's running

11m 46s it says
