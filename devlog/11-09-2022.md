My productivity will drop, I'm using the Pinebook Pro now.

Mostly productivity will drop due to having to use Kate.

Can't get VS Code in Alpine Linux.

Also this trackpad is not great, I know you could use Vim and not use a mouse at all but yeah.

Also currently split screening on 1080P/14" monitor until I get i3 up

I am mad distracted so not sure how productive today... I was trying to build this Debian image but got blocked till I get a response.

5 firefox tabs open, kate, at 1.2GB ram used

Yeah okay need Debian host, going to work on that
