let's gooooooooo

late start, slept in some, reminiscing about the past too (old database entries)

got my SoundCloud get pumped set going (Future Funk mostly)

Going to immediately build out a basic interface, so I can have something to interact with, then setup sqlite with the Rust part.

Oh okay so `$npm run dev` is just the react part that's nice and then `$npm run tauri dev` actually builds the desktop app

10:36 AM

got distracted back on

I gotta save the binding from the input to rust, will need that later

```
// input value stored locally
// calls this function

async function greet() {
  // Learn more about Tauri commands at https://tauri.app/v1/guides/features/command
  setGreetMsg(await invoke("greet", { name }));
}

// to hit rust
// then src-tauri has rust code in it
#[tauri::command]
fn greet(name: &str) -> String {
  format!("Hello, {}! You've been greeted from Rust!", name)
}

// how does it go from rust back to JS?
// oh it sets the state in react from whatever rust returns (setGreetMsg)
// also this invoke thing
```

Okay

10:48 AM

can't get lost in early optimization

I think I'll go for dark theme
