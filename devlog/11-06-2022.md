10:27 AM

let's gooooooooo

late start, slept in some, reminiscing about the past too (old database entries)

got my SoundCloud get pumped set going (Future Funk mostly)

Going to immediately build out a basic interface, so I can have something to interact with, then setup sqlite with the Rust part.

Oh okay so `$npm run dev` is just the react part that's nice and then `$npm run tauri dev` actually builds the desktop app

10:36 AM

got distracted back on

I gotta save the binding from the input to rust, will need that later

```
// input value stored locally
// calls this function

async function greet() {
  // Learn more about Tauri commands at https://tauri.app/v1/guides/features/command
  setGreetMsg(await invoke("greet", { name }));
}

// to hit rust
// then src-tauri has rust code in it
#[tauri::command]
fn greet(name: &str) -> String {
  format!("Hello, {}! You've been greeted from Rust!", name)
}

// how does it go from rust back to JS?
// oh it sets the state in react from whatever rust returns (setGreetMsg)
// also this invoke thing
```

Okay

10:48 AM

can't get lost in early optimization

I think I'll go for dark theme

11:15 AM

coffee refill, water, switching music to metal

this is mostly shit out code kind of development, don't have to think too much

I don't have all day today and I lose productivity later on, so main goals are:

- [ ] build basic search, open, write interface
- [ ] remote sync system (still to local pi unencrypted/no auth)
- [ ] tabbing
- [ ] recent notes
- [ ] split tabs

Mostly I want it to be usable end of 

ugh the jsx parser is acting up

so weird have to close and reopen the file to get rid of the anxiety-inducing red squigglys

11:47 AM
I don't get the semi colons in rust hmm

Oh okay the `->` means return

11:56 AM

hmm my app output is blank damn

okay command is `$npm run tauri build`

damn this build time is nuts

still broken dang

12:04 PM

okay back on, had some react error with async/arrow "destroy is not a function"

the rust logger is working nice, though it's not taking my specific message

going to jump into sqlite right away since that's new to me (I learned it long time ago but never used again)

https://crates.io/crates/sqlite

adding to toml

ooh I see it installing nice

12:18 PM

oh yeah, if I kill the app do I lose the data?

12:32 PM

I'm strugglin, keep running into errors with Rust syntax

12:43 PM

trying to figure out where this db is

losing track of what I'm trying to do

wonder what that means "thread-safe db connection"

functions correctly during simultaneous execution by multiple threads

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2033879/what-does-threadsafe-mean

I might focus on the UI work to have something that works/mock responses/and events

1:48 PM

I've lost some drive but will keep going for a couple more hours.

Let me see if my global drive search found the database

omg I resorted it nooooo

2:01 PM

I think daylight savings ended last night so I actually slept in more

2:07 PM

man I'm losing drive already, sad...

2:31 PM

not doing work... will see if I can get some mock data/side panel going
