let me see if I can get myself going here, I'm kind of feeling lazy today

1:28 PM

wow even the initial `$npm run tauri dev` call is slow on a gaming computer

It's the `crates.io` fetching that's taking some time, I have fiber too

1:38 PM

going to force myself to build this thing... early meal and another energy drink

I'm writing a medium post too as I build it

2:01 PM

if you cringe at your old code that's progress right?

2:04 PM

taking a break, but will build this, thinking of it as "self-paid" work for all the random crap I've bought/put myself into further debt recently.

4:30 PM

being lazy not happening today
